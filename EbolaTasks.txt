Tasks needed to be accomplished for shifting to Ebola outbreak focus:

  (R)Replace Triage Centers with Ebola Hospitals (4 Hrs)
    - (R) Download and parse Ebola Hospital data into database (6 Hrs)
    - (R) Allow Ebola patients to be moved to a Hospital and keep track of their
      condition. (1 Hr) 
  (R)Move map focus area to relevant area(s) (1 Hr)
    - (O)Add ability for map to "remember" last location so when page refreshes 
    it doesn't snap back to default (3 Hrs)
    - (O)Can also add drop down to select default area if we want to allow users
    to pick which country they're focusing on (3 Hrs)
  (R)Add new Ebola patient option (4 Hrs)
    - (R)Add new button on report page for Ebola patients (2 Hr)
    - (R)Add new Map indicator for Ebola patients (2 Hrs)
    - (O)Add Ebola patient as it's own category instead of a patient status (3 Hrs)
      * This would allow us to add a patient status to the Ebola patient
    - (O)Add filter to map and report listing to only show Ebola patients (4 Hrs)
    - (O)Add display groupings to Mobile Reports page (5 Hrs)
      * Large buttons allowing users to shift from reporting on structures to
        reporting on outbreak victims without crowding the screen. Without
        grouping some of the stuff together the buttons won't be large enough to
        be used as easily as desired.
  (O)Add patient "history" (6 Hrs)
    - Add ability to keep track of where patient was picked up from, transported
      to, any status changes, etc.
  (O)Add Patient "groupings" for patients near each other (8 Hrs or more)
    - When multiple patients are close enough determining how many are in that
      location is difficult when zoomed out. Adding the ability to see all 
      patients within a certain radius when hovering over that area would make 
      map more readable
